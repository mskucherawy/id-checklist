GUIDELINES

1. General Considerations

The Internet-Drafts (I-D) repository is one of the primary functions of the
IETF's "datatracker".  It is made available to provide authors with the
ability to distribute and solicit comments on documents they may eventually
submit for publication as a Request For Comment (RFC).

I-Ds are not an archival document series.  I-Ds should not be cited or quoted
in any formal document, except as "work in progress".

Unrevised documents placed in the I-D repository have a maximum life of
185 days.  After that time, if the I-D is not updated, it will be deleted.
See [RFC 2026] for more information.  In exceptional circumstances, an
extension of this lifetime is possible; see Section X below.

After a document becomes an RFC, it will be marked as replaced by that RFC
in the I-D repository.

[MSK: This paragraph and the next probably need revision.]
[BJK: Yes!]

I-Ds are generally in the format of an RFC, although they may be rough drafts
when the first version is submitted. This format is specified fully in
"Instructions to RFC Authors" (on the RFC Editor's Web pages [RFCED]). In
brief, an I-D must be submitted in ASCII text, and should be limited to 72
characters per line and 58 lines per page, and each page ends with a formfeed
character. Overstriking to achieve bolding or underlining is not acceptable.

PostScript and/or PDF are acceptable, but only when submitted with a matching
ASCII version (even if figures must be omitted). PostScript and PDF should be
formatted for use on 8.5x11 inch paper. If A4 paper is used, an image area
no greater than 254mm high should be used to avoid printing extra pages when
printed on 8.5x11 paper.

There are differences between the RFC and I-D formats. I-Ds are NOT RFCs,
and I-Ds are NOT a numbered document series. The label "INTERNET-DRAFT"
should appear in the upper left hand corner of the first page. If the I-D is
associated with an IETF working group, the name of the working group should
appear on the line below the "INTERNET-DRAFT" label. The document should NOT
refer to itself as an RFC or a draft RFC.

The I-D should neither state nor imply that it has any standards status;
to do so conflicts with the roles of the RFC Editor and the IESG. The title
of the document should not imply a status. Avoid the use of the terms
Standard, Proposed, Draft, Experimental, Historic, Required, Recommended,
Elective, or Restricted in the I-D title. Indicating what intended status
the I-D if it is published as an RFC is fine; however, this should be done
with the words "Intended status: <status>" on the left side of the first page.

2. Submissions

ALL submissions to the Internet-Draft directories should use the I-D
Submission tool [IDST].

If you run into problems when submitting an Internet-Draft using the
I-D Submission tool, or it is not available or you are offline, you may
alternatively submit your draft by email to internet-drafts@ietf.org.
However, be advised that manual processing always takes additional time.

When using the email submission method, the I-D may be sent as an attachment
to the message, or the message may contain a URL that points to a copy of
the I-D stored on a server.

Attachments must be plain text, PostScript, or PDF. These are the only
formats that are currently supported for I-Ds, and any other attachment,
such as a ZIP file, will be discarded without opening.

See the section below on document naming.

A document submitted to a working group for the first time (i.e., as
"draft-ietf-WGNAME-..." requires approval of the working group chairs
before it can be posted to the I-D repository.

When you submit an I-D, you will receive an acknowledgement message from
the Secretariat. The subject and details are different for acknowledments
from the I-D Submission Tool and submission by email. If you do not
receive an acknowledgement within two business hours (in the Pacific time
zone) after submitting your Internet-Draft, please contact the Secretariat
by sending a message to ietf-action@ietf.org. The suggested subject line
for this note is: "Status of I-D Submission: <filename>". If you need to
track the status of your Internet-Draft at a later date, please send a
message to ietf-action@ietf.org (using the suggested subject line
"Status of I-D Submission: <filename>") and include the acknowledgement for
your document in the body.

3. IPR-Related Notices Required in Internet-Drafts

BCP 78 and BCP 79 specify the IETF's Intellectiual Property policies.
Among them is a requirement to include certain standardized text in each
I-D.  As this text can change from time to time by the IETF Trust, it is
not cited directly here.  Authors are directed to read BCP 78 [RFC 5378] for
further information.  Any I-D submitted that doesn not inclue one of the
required IPR boilerplate statements will be returned to the submitter.
The IETF Secretariat cannot add it for the author.

If the submitter desires to eliminate the IETF's right to make modifications
and derivative works of an Internet-Draft, one of the following two notices
may be included after the IPR statement. The first choice is used if the
contributor intends for the I-D to be published as an RFC.   The first choice
is:

"This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not
be created, except to format it for publication as an RFC or to translate
it into languages other than English."

The second choice is when the contributor does not intend for the I-D to
be published as an RFC. The second choice is:

"This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not be
created, and it may not be published except as an Internet-Draft."

These notices may not be used with any IETF standards-track document or
with most working group documents, except as discussed in BCP 78 [RFC 5378],
since the IETF must retain change control over its documents and the
ability to augment, clarify and enhance the original contribution in
accordance with the IETF Standards Process.

The first choice may be appropriate when republishing standards produced by
a standards body other than the IETF, industry consortia or companies. These
are typically published as Informational RFCs, and do not require that
change control be ceded to the IETF. Documents of this type convey
information for the Internet community.

The second choice may be used on I-Ds that are intended to provide background
information to educate and to facilitate discussions within IETF working
groups but are not intended to be published as RFCs.

If you think that you, your company, or anyone else owns a patent or other
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) on the work described in the I-D, you
should carefully read BCP 79 [RFC 8179].  The first notice required in an
I-D, described earlier in this section, obligates you to send an IPR
disclosure statement under certain circumstances. Before submitting the
I-D, it is advisable to talk to the working group chair or area directors
about it.

N.  Submission Deadlines

Before each IETF meeting, a deadline is announced for submitting documents
ahead of time to be published for discussion at the meeting.
The only exception is for version -00 working group drafts that
replace existing non-working-group documents; these documents may be
submitted up to the deadline for new versions of existing documents.

Care should be taken when submitting an I-D near the deadline. The Secretariat
receives hundreds of I-Ds immediately preceding an IETF meeting, and it can
take several days to process and post them all, especially the ones that
do not use the I-D Submission Tool. If an I-D that was submitted very close to
the deadline has not been posted and announced within three days, then the
submitter should send a message to ietf-action@ietf.org (using the suggested
subject line "Status of I-D Submission: <filename>") and reference the
acknowledgement for the document in the body of the message. The Secretariat
will happily investigate the situation and post any valid submission that
was not posted in the first round.

N+1.  Expiring

An Internet-Draft will expire exactly 185 days from the date that it is
posted on the IETF Web site (<http://www.ietf.org/id-info/>) unless it
is replaced by an updated version (in which case the clock will start all
over again for the new version, and the old version will be removed from the
I-D repository), or unless it is under official review by the IESG
(i.e., a request to publish it as an RFC has been submitted). Specifically,
when an I-D enters the "Publication Requested" state in the Data Tracker
[TRACK], it will not be expired until its status is resolved (e.g., it is
published as an RFC). Data Tracker states not associated with a formal request
to publish a document (e.g., "AD is Watching") will not prevent an I-D
from expiring.

I-Ds will not expire during the period surrounding an IETF meeting when
posting of updates to I-Ds is suspended (i.e., between the cutoff date
for submission of updated I-Ds, which is usually two weeks prior to an
IETF meeting, and the date that posting of I-Ds resumes). All I-Ds scheduled
to expire during this period will expire on the day that the Secretariat once
again begins posting I-Ds.

When an I-D expires, a "tombstone" file will be created that includes the
filename and version number of the I-D that has expired. The filename of the
tombstone file will be the same as that of the expired I-D with the version
number increased by one. If a revised version of an expired I-D is submitted
for posting, then the revised version will replace the tombstone file and
must have the same version number as that previously assigned to the
tombstone file. Tombstone files will never expire and will always be
available for reference unless they are replaced by updated versions of the
subject I-D or the expired version is brought back by the explicit action
of an Area Director.

An expired I-D may be unexpired when necessary to further the work of the
IETF, including IETF liaison with other standards bodies. Such action will be
taken by request of an IESG member, a chair of the working group associated
with the I-D, or one of the document authors. Such a request may be
overridden; e.g., a chair of the working group associated with the I-D will
be notified if an author requests unexpiration and may request that the
action not occur. This request should be sent to internet-drafts@ietf.org
(using the suggested subject line "Resurrect I-D <filename>") and should come
from an author, a working group chair, or an IESG member.

The expiration date of an unexpired I-D may be extended with the same rules
as unexpiration. This request should be sent to internet-drafts@ietf.org
(using the suggested subject line "Extend expiration date for <filename>")
and should be from an author, a working group chair, or an IESG member.

4. General Content Considerations

4.1. Abstract

Every Internet-Draft must have an Abstract section. The Abstract should
provide a concise and comprehensive overview of the purpose and contents of
the entire document. Its purpose is to give a technically knowledgeable
reader a general overview of the function of the document, to decide whether
reading it will be useful. In addition to its function in the document,
the Abstract section is used as a summary in publication announcements and
in the online index of I-Ds [INDEX].

Composing a useful Abstract is a non-trivial writing task. Often, a
satisfactory abstract can be constructed in part from material from the
Introduction section, but a good abstract will be shorter, less detailed,
and broader in scope than the Introduction. Simply copying and pasting the
first few paragraphs of the Introduction is tempting, but it generally
results in an Abstract that is both incomplete and redundant.

An Abstract will typically be 5-10 lines.  An Abstract of more than 20
lines or fewer than 3 lines is generally not acceptable.

An Abstract should be complete in itself, so it should contain no citations
unless they are completely defined within the Abstract. Abbreviations
appearing in the Abstract should generally be expanded in parentheses.
There is a small set of reasonable exceptions to this rule; for example,
readers don't need to be reminded of what "IP" or "TCP" or "MIB" means.
The RFC Editor maintains a list of approved abbreviations that do not need
to be expanded; see https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/abbrev.expansion.txt.
In the end, therefore, this is a judgment call, but please err on the side
of explicitness.

4.2.  Contact Information

In addition, the I-D should contain a section giving name and contact
information (postal mail, voice/fax number and/or e-mail) for the authors.

4.3.  File Naming

All I-Ds must contain the full filename (beginning with "draft-" and
including the version number) in the text of the document. The filename
information should, at a minimum, appear on the first page (possibly with the
title). I-D filenames use ONLY lowercase characters.

An Internet-Draft filename is made up of several components, each separated
by a hyphen. No empty components are permitted. The components, in order are:

a. "draft"

b. Document source.  For a working group document, this will be the string
   "ietf".  For other IETF-specific sources, this component names that
   source.  The currently allowed list is:

   * iab
   * iana
   * iaoc
   * iesg
   * ietf-edu
   * ietf-tools
   * ietf-trust
   * irtf
   * rfc-editor

   If the source is an individual rather than an IETF source, a string
   related to the name(s) of the author(s) is used.  There are no mechanical
   rules for this component but objectionable or misleading strings are
   subject to change or removal at the discretion of the Secretariat.

c. Document name.  For working group documents, this will be the working
   group's short name, and the remainder of the name specifies the purpose
   of the document, usually in just a few words.

d. Document version, as a two-digit decimal number. The initial version of
   any document is "00".

Convention dictates that an individual submission seeking adoption by
a working group will include the working group's sohort name in the first
name component after the author name.  For example, a person using a name
component "foo" seeking to get a document about "subject" adopted by working
group "bar" might name it "draft-foo-bar-subject-00".  If the document is
later adopted by the working group, the authors resubmit the document as
"draft-ietf-bar-subject-00".  Note that the version number must be reset
to 00 when its name changes.

For those authors submitting updates to existing I-D, the choice of the
I-D filename is easily determined: increment the version by 1. For new
documents, submit the document with a suggested I-D filename following
the above rules. Note that if the suggested filename is not acceptable for
some reason (e.g., not getting working group chair approval for a working
group document), the document will have to be resubmitted with an acceptable
I-D filename.

N+2.  Further Reading

This document is for helping authors. If you need the definitive rules,
then read the following documents:

The IETF Standards Process is described in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].

The IETF rules concerning copyright are described in BCP 78 [RFC5378].

The IETF rules on IPR are described in BCP 79 [RFC8179].

The IETF Trust Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents [TLP], called
"the TLP" for short, provide many details about copyright policy and practice.

There are several tools to help the process of writing an I-D in this format;
the RFC Editor has collected several pointers on their web page
(<http://www.rfc-editor.org/formatting.html>).

Henrik Levkowetz has written an excellent tool that checks for many common
issues: <http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/>.

The I-D Checklist <http://www.ietf.org/id-info/checklist.html> is a good
reference when submitting a document to the IESG for publication as an RFC.

Also, the RFC Editor's Web pages on how to publish an RFC will be
useful [RFCED].

DOCUMENT QUALITY CHECKLIST

1. General Considerations about Document Quality

All Internet Drafts (I-Ds) that are offered to an Area Director (AD) or the
Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) with a request for publication as
an RFC must conform to the following requirements or they will be returned
to the author(s) or editor(s) for revision.

The Working Group (WG) Chairs are responsible for having this list checked
before submission to an Area Director to begin the review and publication
process.

A handy tool (awk script) to check most of the formatting nits (as in
Sections 2.1 and 2.2 below) is available at
http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/, courtesy of Henrik Levkowetz.

Another set of handy tools is available at the IETF TOOLS pages, which
can be found at https://tools.ietf.org/.

Checking for content related issues (as in Sections 2.3, 3, and 4 below)
needs a human eye.

All content issues have to be checked early in the development of documents,
being technically integral. The WG Chairs are responsible for this too.
The ADs will not accept the document and so will not put it on the IESG
agenda if this check has not been done.

Responsibility for all checking is with the authors in the case of an
individual submission.

This document only talks about "finished" Internet-Drafts, that is, those I-Ds
for which the IESG gets a request for publication.  However, it is strongly
recommended to follow these guidelines for documents that go to WG Last
Call as well.

Guidelines for all Internet-Drafts are in Guidelines to Authors of
Internet-Drafts, and are not repeated here.

As a suggestion for productivity improvement, it is strongly recommended to
use a toolchain intended for producing I-Ds and RFCs, such as XML2RFC v3 [RFC
7991] (Hoffman, P., "The xml2rfc Version 3 Vocabulary," December 2016),
kramdown-rfc (https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc2629), or similar.  There is
even an online xml2rfc tool to generate the Internet-Draft .txt files at
https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/ that supports v2 and v3 XML2RFC formats as
well as an experimental converter from KramDown to XML2RFC format.  These
tools automatically take care of most of the formatting, administrative and
bureaucratic rules.

2. Form Nits

2.1.  Formatting

In principle, the RFC Editor can take care of a few small formatting errors.
And, if there are only a few, then they will do so.  However, if many errors
exist, the document will be returned to the author(s), editor(s), or the
WG for fixes.  In any event, please realize that not following the formatting
rules will most probably delay publication and does consume time that can
be spend on other work.

See the RFC Style Guide [RFC 7322] (Flanagan, H., and Ginoza, S., "RFC Style
Guide", September 2014) for further rules.  A checklist of formatting problems
rules that often get neglected is provided here:

* No text beyond the 72nd column of a line. This is especially important
  for diagrams and code, which the RFC Editor may not be able to trivially
  reformat to fall within the margins.

* Must be ragged right

* No hyphenation for line breaks. However, hyphenated words (e.g.,
  "Internet-Draft") may be split at the hyphen across successive lines.

* No footnotes

* The allowed characters are limited: while RFCs have traditionally been
  ASCII-only with no control characters other than CR, NL, and FF, limited
  use of Unicode characters (in UTF-8) is permitted by RFC 7997.  Use of
  non-ASCII characters should still be limited to when there is a specific
  need, most notably for names.  Many uses of non-ASCII characters will
  require listing the Unicode codepoint by number in addition to the
  character itself.

* Do not number the "Status of Memo" or "Abstract" sections

* Do not add a numbered reference in the I-D boilerplate to RFC 5378 or RFC
  5379 (or to RFC 2026, RFC 3667, RFC 3668, RFC 3978, or RFC 3979 for older
  documents).

* Reasonably well formatted for readibility and clarity

2.2.  Required Sections - All I-Ds

The following are REQUIRED sections in all Internet-Drafts:

* Internet Draft boilerplate

  * It must not contain boilerplate that prohibits publication as an RFC; see
    [RFC 5378] (Bradner, S., Contreras, J., "Rights Contributors Provide to the
    IETF Trust," November 2008), Section 3.3.

  * List of authors/editors; there should not be more than five authors or
    editors (see http://www.rfc-editor.org/policy.html)

  * Abstract

  * Table of Contents, required in all documents.

  * Introduction

  * Security Considerations; see [BCP 72][RFC 3552] (Rescorla, E., Korver, B.,
    and Internet Architecture Board, "Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on
    Security Considerations," July 2003).

  * IANA Considerations
    A. Must specify if IANA has to create a new registry or modify rules for
    an existing registry.

    B. Must specify if the document requires IANA to assign or update values
    in an IANA registry before RFC publication.  Consider the following:

    - Please check the existing IANA registry for registration policy rules
      and any requirements for specific requests for registration of
      protocol parameters.  Individual RFCs have specific criteria and
      instructions that should be followed.

    - If the registration policy is "Expert Review" or "Specification Required"
      and/or requires mailing list review, as soon as the rquested parameter
      information is properly formed, consider initiating reviews with IANA
      or sending to the mailing list (where applicable; see the RFC that
      the registry for instructions).  If there are any questions about what
      type of approval is needed from the Designated Expert (for example, if
      the registration should me made immediately or only pre-reviewed before
      publication), please contact IANA.

    - If registrations are needed early for "Specification Required",
      "RFC Required", "IETF Review", or "Standards Action", consider using
      the early allocation process defined in RFC 7120.

    - Please indicate if any references to this document should be added for
      any registrations or if they should replace existing references.

    C. For more specific guidelines regarding structure and content for
    writing IANA Considerations sections, please see "Guidelines for Writing
    an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs" [RFC 8126] (Cotton, M., Leiba, B.,
    and Narten, T., "Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in
    RFCs," June 2017).  Practical help and guidelines cna be found here:
    https://www.iana.org/help/protocol-registration

    D. If the document has considerable instructions for IANA actions,
    request an early review of the document by IANA.

    E. If there is no action for IANA, the section should say that, e.g.,
    include something like "This document has no actions for IANA."
    It's often helpful for a document's IANA Considerations section to remain
    in place upon publication even if there are no actions, but it can be
    removed by the RFC Editor upon the authors' request.

  * References, which must be split into normative and informative sections
    (see the RFC Style Guide [RFC 7322] (Flanagan, H., and Ginoza, S., "RFC
    Style Guide", September 2014), and
    https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/normative-informative-references/)).

  * Author's Address (see the RFC Style Guide for this as well).

  * IPR Disclosure Acknowledgment; see [RFC 5378] (Bradner, S.,
    Contreras, J., "Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust", November
    2008).

  * IPR Notice, verbatim from [RFC 8179] (Bradner, S., Contreras, J.,
    "Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology," March 2005.). If this
    and the previous notice are not present, then the RFC-Editor will add them,
    but it will speed up the process if the notices are already present in the
    Internet-Draft.

  * Copyright Notice and Disclaimer, as is present in the current Legend
    Instructions.  For further details, see [RFC 5378] (Bradner, S., and
    Contreras, J., "Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust", November
    2008), Section 6.

3. Content Issues

This section describes content issues that are common to many documents,
non-adherence to which will degrade the quality of the document and result
in further iteration and work needed.  Authors, editors, document shepherds,
and working group chairs are advised to observe these before submitting
a document for publication.

3.1. Abstract

* See Section 4.3 in the RFC Style Guide (cited above).

* Should be meaningful to someone not versed in the technology; most
  abbreviations must be expanded on first use.

* No citations should be present.

* If your document obsoletes or updates a previous RFC, then the Abstract
  should say so explicitly.

        Add the "Updates:" and "Obsoletes:" lines on the frontpage. Here is
        an example of what the frontpage should look like:

           Network Working Group                                <yourname>
           Internet-Draft                               <your affiliation>
           Obsoletes: xxxx (if approved)                   August 29, 2006
           Updates: yyyy, zzzz (if approved)
           Intended status: Best Current Practice
           Expires: February 21, 2007

           ...

           Abstract

           This document describes .....

           It obsoletes RFC xxxx and updates RFC yyyy and RFC zzzz

3.2.  Updating or Obsoleting Existing Documents

If your document updates or obsoletes (replaces) an existing document,
it is expected that the following will be present in your document:

* A sentence in the Abstract that says so (see above).

* A more complete explanation in the Introduction of how and why this
  document updates or obsoletes the earlier document.

* A section, usually near the end, that summarizes the changes from the
  document that is being updated or obsoleted.

* If your new document addresses any errata registered against the older
  document, those should be identified in the summary of changes section.

3.3.  Security Considerations section

As cited above, [RFC 3552] provides current best guidance about writing
a Security Considerations section.  This section is mandatory in all
documents.

The text of this section must have a meaningful exploration of security issues
raised by the proposal, which should include both risks and description of
solutions or workarounds.  It is rare that technical work can legitimately
make a claim like "This protocol introduces no security considerations,"
so it needs to be fairly obvious for that to be believable, or the document
will be returned for further development.

If applicable, you may also find help in [RFC 5406] (Bellovin, S., "Guidelines
for Specifying the Use of IPsec Version 2," February 2009).

It is also important to use the proper terminology for security terms, as
defined in [RFC 4949] (Shirey, R., "Internet Security Glossary, Version 2,"
August 2007).

For MIB documents, [RFC4181] (Heard, C., "Guidelines for Authors and
Reviewers of MIB Documents", September 2005) should be used as a starting
point.  See also the YANG security considerations page at
https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-security-guidelines.

3.4.  Normative Language

If capitalized MUST, SHOULD, etc., is used, then it is expected that BCP 14's
boilerplate will be included in an appropriate definitions section, and cited
as a normative reference.  BCP 14 is made up of [RFC 2119] (Bradner, S.,
"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels," March 1997) and
[RFC 8174] (Leiba, B., "Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key
Words", May 2017), and they must be cited as described in the latter document.

Also, authors need to use this langauge in accordance with the guidelines
specified in RFC 2119.

3.5.  IPR Statements

Specific Intellectual Property Rights (IPR, e.g., patent claims and terms)
must not be in an RFC (or Internet-Draft).  Any claims must be submitted via
the IETF IPR web page as notice that there is some IPR claim.  The mandatory
IPR Notice from [RFC 8179] (Bradner, S., and Contreras, J., "Intellectual
Property Rights in IETF Technology," May 2017) points readers to the IETF
IPR web page.

3.6.  Formal Languages

Use of formal languages should be in conformance with the IESG statement
on the use of formal languages; see:

    IESG Statement: Guidelines for the Use of Formal Languages in IETF
    Specifications

...at:

    https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/formal-languages-use/

In particular:

A. All MIB modules should have correct syntax, so they should compile cleanly
using:

          smilint -m -s -l 6 -i namelength-32

An online WEB service is available for syntax checking at:
http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/projects/libsmi/tools/.

This allows you to extract the MIB module from a document for your own local
use, but you can also directly run a syntax check. You can also download the
libsmi tools for local use.

In most cases there should be no errors or warnings present in the report.
Please evaluate all diagnostic messages before assuming that they are OK. If
in doubt, feel free to check on the ietfmibs@ietf.org mailing list or with
the OPS ADs.

B. Besides the syntax checking, a MIB document should also be checked against
[RFC 4181] and [RFC 4841] (Heard, C., "RFC 4181 Update to Recognize the
IETF Trust," March 2007)

C. All ABNF must be checked.  A tool is available at http://www.apps.ietf.org.
See [RFC 5234] (Crocker, D. and P. Overell, "Augmented BNF for Syntax
Specifications: ABNF," January 2008) for information about IETF ABNF.  If
ABNF is used, you must include a normative reference to RFC 5234.

D. Protocol specifications that use XML should always use well-formed XML at
a minimum. Sample XML instances included in a specification have to be
well-formed, and if the XML is supposed to be valid (according to the current
W3C definition of validity), the samples must reference and be validated
using an appropriate XML Schema, DTD, or other standard validation mechanism
that is structurally and syntactically correct. Links to tools to check XML
validity, including a schema checker and a validating parser, can be found at
http://www.apps.ietf.org.  Other guidelines for the use of XML in IETF
protocols can be found in BCP 70 [RFC 3470] (Hollenbeck, S., Rose, M.,
and L. Masinter, "Guidelines for the Use of Extensible Markup Language (XML)
within IETF Protocols," January 2003).

E. XML provides structures, such as the "<any>" element information item in XML
Schema, to allow element extensions. If these structures are included in a
protocol, the protocol specification must include clear guidance on how,
when, and where the extension structures, such as versioning, can be used.

F. XML Schemas, Namespaces, and Resource Description Framework (RDF) Schemas
should be registered with the IANA using the procedures described in BCP 81
[RFC 3688] (Mealling, M., "The IETF XML Registry," January 2004).

3.7.  Example Addresses

Addresses used in examples should use fully qualified domain names instead
of literal IP addresses, and should use example FQDNs such as
"foo.example.com" instead of real-world FQDNs.  See [RFC 2606] (Eastlake, D.
and A. Panitz, "Reserved Top Level DNS Names," June 1999) for example domain
names that can be used.  Note that the entire .example TLD is reserved,
allowing for arbitrary subdomains (in particular, ones that are not
considered same-origin on the Web).

There are also ranges of IP addresses set aside for this purpose.  For IPv4,
these are defined in [RFC 3330] (IANA, "Special-Use IPv4 Addresses,"
September 2002); for IPv6, see [RFC 3849] (Huston, G., Lord, A.,
and P. Smith, "IPv6 Address Prefix Reserved for Documentation," July 2004).
Per the IAB Statement on IPv6
(https://www.iab.org/2016/11/07/iab-statement-on-ipv6/), IPv6 examples
should be used.
[MSK: s/RFC 3330/RFC 5735/]

Private addresses that would be used in the real world are to be avoided in
examples.

Similarly, real telephone numbers should not be used.  Instead use those
numbers that were reserved for examples or fictitious use. Available numbers
for use in examples are:

* UK: +44-<geographic-area-code>-496-<0000-0999>

* USA: +1-<area code>-555-<0100-0199> (see
https://www.nationalnanpa.com/pdf/NRUF/ATIS-0300115.pdf)

3.8.  References

All references must be stable and resolvable.

A bare HTTP URL is not generally considered a stable reference.  For
Web-only documents, adding a reference number, title and/or an author will
help make the reference more stable.
[MSK: I think this is no longer strictly true.  Are there guidelines that
are more current?]
[BJK: this does not seem accurate, though I don't have a reference for
what is accurate right at hand]

Judgment can be used here; the stability of normative references is even
more important than the stability of informative references.

In case of references to Internet-Drafts, use the format: author, "title"
(I-D file name).

Normative references to I-Ds will cause a standards-track or BCP document to
wait in the RFC-Editor queue (see RFC-Editor queue) for the referenced I-Ds
to be published as RFCs.

Normative and informative references to non-IETF documents are permitted.
However, it is best to minimize such normative references, because assessing
their status when the IETF document advances on the standards-track is very
difficult. It is important to use the exact title, author name(s),
organization and publication date.  External specificiations referenced by
Internet Standard-level Technical Speification or Applicability Statements
must be open external standards [RFC2026].
[BJK: we probably want to wordsmith this some more]

3.9.  Stale Text

Avoid text that will become outdated after RFC is published.  Examples include
non-permanent URLs, mentions of specific mailing lists as places to send
comments on a document, or referring to specific WGs as a place to perform
specific future actions (e.g., reviewing followup documents). In some cases
(like the ORGANIZATION clause in MIB modules), references to working groups
are impossible to avoid; however, generally, Internet-Drafts should not assign
powers or responsibilities to WGs unless the WG in question will exist as long
as the practice documented in the published RFC remains valid. In cases where
a specific WG is expected to be a focal point for future action, it is
acceptable to give the task to the IESG, giving instructions on how the action
is expected to be delegated, e.g., by forwarding to an appropriate WG or other
set of experts.

4. Protocol Issues

This section provides some general guidance that will help to avoid extended
discussion during the document review and approval process:

Avoid IPv4 specificity. Both IPv4 and IPv6 must be supportable, unless
the protocol is naturally IPv4 specific or IPv6 specific.

No application can be permitted to cause catastrophic congestion.  See
[RFC 2914] (Floyd, S., "Congestion Control Principles," September 2000) for
details.  Applications using TCP or SCTP will normally fulfill this
requirement automatically.  Applications using UDP should adhere to the
guidance in RFC 8085.

If any sort of end-to-end checksum or integrity check is being used
(especially, but not limited to, cryptographic checksums or MACs), specify
precisely the contents of the fields to be checksummed, and in exactly what
order the operations are done. Pay special attention to any area reserved
for the checksum itself.

All user-visible text fields must be internationalizable.  See [RFC 2277]
(Alvestrand, H., "IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages," January
1998). For most cases, this means UTF-8 [RFC 3629] (Yergeau, F., "UTF-8, a
transformation format of ISO 10646," November 2003).

If text fields are included in some calculation, like matching, sorting,
etc., it must be described in detail how those operations are applied to the
Unicode/ISO 10646 character set. See "stringprep" [RFC 8264] (Saint-Andre, P.
and M. Blanchet, "PRECIS Framework: Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison
of Internationalized Strings in Application Protocols", December 2017)
for more information on the recommended way of handling comparisons.
